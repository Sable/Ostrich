This software may be distributed under the terms of the "Berkeley License",

other terms or licenses without prior written agreement with the author.
Please read the associated files in the subdirectory "LICENSES" for
licensing information.  and remember, you may choose *either* of these
licenses.  (You are also welcome to try to distribute it under all of them,
but this may prove more difficult.) Other distribution terms may be
available by explicit request; mail me for details.

This software is no longer available under the GPL.  As you will doubtless
notice, the version of the Berkeley license I use still has the dreaded
"advertising clause", so this software cannot be redistributed under the GPL.
I am doing this because one of the FSF people told me that, if I don't
explicitly warn people that they *can't* link my code with GPL'd code, that
I am magically *required* to redistribute my code under the GPL.  I'd rather
retain some artistic control here.  ;)
